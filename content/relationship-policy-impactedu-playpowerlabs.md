# Relationship Policy: Wisdom Frontiers / Impact-Edu.ai and PlayPower Labs Pvt. Ltd.

**Adopted by the Board of Directors on [DATE]**

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy governs the relationship between Wisdom Frontiers (a California nonprofit corporation, 501(c)(3) pending) operating the Impact-Edu.ai program, and PlayPower Labs Pvt. Ltd. (a for-profit company incorporated in Gujarat, India). Both entities share a common founder: Derek Lomas, PhD, who serves as Program Director of Impact-Edu.ai and as CEO of PlayPower Labs.

This paired structure is intentional. Impact-Edu.ai produces open public goods — research, data, and tools — that advance equitable access to AI-powered learning. PlayPower Labs provides commercial services — consulting, product development, and deployment — that help education organizations implement effective learning technology. The nonprofit creates the open infrastructure; the for-profit builds products and services on top of it.

This model is well-established in the technology and research sectors (e.g., Mozilla Foundation / Mozilla Corporation; Wikimedia Foundation / Wikimedia Enterprise; The Learning Agency / Learning Agency Lab). However, because the entities share a founder who exercises significant influence over both, this policy establishes safeguards to ensure that Wisdom Frontiers operates exclusively for charitable purposes and that no private benefit or inurement accrues to PlayPower Labs, Derek Lomas, or any other insider.

This policy supplements Wisdom Frontiers' Conflict of Interest Policy and should be read in conjunction with it.

## 2. Mission Boundary

### 2.1 Wisdom Frontiers / Impact-Edu.ai

Impact-Edu.ai conducts and publishes open research on AI in education, builds open-source tools and assessment infrastructure, and delivers practitioner training. Its outputs include:

- Open item banks with calibrated psychometric parameters
- Open assessment instruments and research datasets
- Peer-reviewed publications and publicly accessible research reports
- Open-source software tools (e.g., difficulty estimators, interview platforms)
- Professional development programs and freely available educational resources

All Impact-Edu.ai outputs funded by grants or donations serve charitable purposes and are made available to the public without restriction.

### 2.2 PlayPower Labs Pvt. Ltd.

PlayPower Labs is a for-profit edtech services company that provides:

- Learning engineering consulting and implementation services
- Custom adaptive learning platform development
- Educational data science and analytics
- Product design and UX research for edtech organizations
- Software development for learning management systems, assessments, and dashboards

PlayPower Labs generates revenue through client contracts and commercial engagements. It operates independently of Wisdom Frontiers and is not a subsidiary, affiliate, or controlled entity of the nonprofit.

### 2.3 The Dividing Line

Impact-Edu.ai creates **open infrastructure**. PlayPower Labs builds **proprietary products and services**, which may build upon that open infrastructure — as may any other organization. Impact-Edu.ai does not exist to generate leads, customers, data, or competitive advantage for PlayPower Labs. Any incidental commercial benefit to PlayPower Labs from Impact-Edu.ai's open outputs must be no greater than the benefit available to any other member of the public.

---

## 3. Intellectual Property

### 3.1 Impact-Edu.ai IP

All intellectual property created with Impact-Edu.ai grant funds, donation-funded resources, or by Wisdom Frontiers staff and contractors working on Impact-Edu.ai projects is owned by Wisdom Frontiers and released under open licenses:

- **Content, data, and publications:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) or equivalent
- **Software and code:** An OSI-approved open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0)
- **Assessment items and psychometric data:** Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY) or equivalent

### 3.2 PlayPower Labs IP

PlayPower Labs' proprietary work — including client deliverables, commercial products, internal tools, and trade secrets — remains the property of PlayPower Labs. Wisdom Frontiers has no claim to PlayPower Labs' commercial IP.

### 3.3 Use of Open Outputs

PlayPower Labs may use Impact-Edu.ai's openly licensed outputs on the same terms as any other organization or individual. There shall be no exclusive access, early access, preferential API access, or any other form of privileged use.

### 3.4 Joint Projects

If the entities collaborate on a project (e.g., a grant-funded study that involves PlayPower Labs' engineering team), intellectual property ownership and licensing terms must be agreed in writing before work begins. The default assumption is that any work funded by Wisdom Frontiers is owned by Wisdom Frontiers and openly licensed per §3.1.

## 4. Contracting and Procurement

### 4.1 General Principle

Impact-Edu.ai may contract PlayPower Labs for services when PlayPower Labs has genuine expertise and capacity that serves the charitable mission. However, every such engagement must withstand scrutiny as an arm's-length transaction that primarily benefits the nonprofit, not the for-profit.

### 4.2 Requirements for All PlayPower Labs Engagements

Any contract between Wisdom Frontiers (including Impact-Edu.ai) and PlayPower Labs must satisfy all of the following:

1. **Fair market value.** The contract price must be at or below fair market value, documented with at least one of: (a) comparable bids from unrelated vendors, (b) a market rate analysis using published salary/rate surveys, or (c) a written justification by a disinterested board member with relevant expertise.

2. **Board approval.** The contract must be approved by a majority vote of disinterested board members. Derek Lomas must recuse himself from discussion and vote. The board's deliberation and rationale must be recorded in the minutes.

3. **Charitable purpose.** The contract scope must be directly tied to a charitable purpose specified in a grant agreement, program plan, or board-approved budget. Contracts for general business operations of PlayPower Labs are prohibited.

4. **Open deliverables.** All work product delivered under the contract must be owned by Wisdom Frontiers and openly licensed per §3.1, unless the board documents a specific exception (e.g., use of a pre-existing PlayPower Labs tool under a separate license).

5. **Written agreement.** The engagement must be documented in a written contract specifying scope, deliverables, timeline, payment terms, IP ownership, and reporting requirements.

### 4.3 Competitive Process Threshold

For any single engagement or series of related engagements with PlayPower Labs exceeding **$50,000 in a fiscal year**, Wisdom Frontiers must conduct a documented competitive process (e.g., request for proposals, solicitation of comparable bids) or provide a written board justification for sole-source procurement, including why PlayPower Labs is uniquely qualified and why a competitive process is impractical.

### 4.4 Diversification

Wisdom Frontiers should actively develop relationships with multiple service providers and work toward diversifying its contractor base so that no single vendor — including PlayPower Labs — accounts for a disproportionate share of contracted services. The board should monitor vendor concentration annually and document its rationale when a single vendor relationship is substantial relative to total program expenditures.

## 5. Personnel

### 5.1 Clear Assignments

Every individual performing work for Wisdom Frontiers must have a clear, documented role — as an employee, contractor, or volunteer — with a defined scope of work. If an individual also works for PlayPower Labs, their Wisdom Frontiers role must be formally separated.

### 5.2 No Cross-Subsidization

No person funded by Wisdom Frontiers grants or donations may perform commercial work for PlayPower Labs during funded hours. Time tracking is required for any individual who works for both entities, with records maintained for at least seven years.

### 5.3 Founder Time Allocation

Derek Lomas' time allocation between Wisdom Frontiers and PlayPower Labs must be:

- Documented through regular time tracking (at minimum, monthly summaries)
- Disclosed to the board annually
- Reflected accurately in compensation from each entity (i.e., he may not draw a full-time salary from both entities for overlapping hours)

### 5.4 Hiring from PlayPower Labs

Wisdom Frontiers may engage PlayPower Labs employees as individual contractors or consultants for specific projects, subject to the procurement rules in §4. Such arrangements must be documented in writing and the individual's PlayPower Labs employment status disclosed to the board.

## 6. Data and Research

### 6.1 Research Data

Research data collected under Impact-Edu.ai studies is governed by applicable IRB protocols, informed consent agreements, and open data commitments. PlayPower Labs has no privileged access to research data beyond what is publicly released.

### 6.2 Data Sharing

- Appropriate participant consent
- De-identification or anonymization procedures
- Compliance with applicable privacy laws (FERPA, COPPA, GDPR, India DPDP Act, etc.)
- Clear terms on permitted uses

### 6.3 System Separation

Neither entity may access the other's proprietary systems, databases, user accounts, or credentials without explicit written authorization specifying the scope and duration of access.

### 7.4 Shared Expenses

If the entities share any expenses (e.g., software subscriptions, cloud infrastructure, travel for overlapping purposes), costs must be allocated using a documented formula approved by the board. Each entity pays its proportionate share directly. Informal cost-sharing or verbal understandings are not acceptable.

Wisdom Frontiers' financial statements shall be reviewed or audited annually by an independent accountant, in accordance with grant requirements and nonprofit best practices. The auditor shall be informed of the relationship with PlayPower Labs and asked to review related-party transactions.

---

## 8. Board Governance

### 8.1 Independent Majority

The Wisdom Frontiers board must maintain a majority of directors who are independent — meaning they have no financial relationship with PlayPower Labs, receive no compensation from PlayPower Labs, and have no family or business relationship with Derek Lomas beyond their board service.

### 8.2 Recusal

For any matter involving PlayPower Labs, Derek Lomas must:

1. Disclose the conflict at the start of the discussion
2. Provide any information the board requests
3. Leave the room (or disconnect from the call) during deliberation and vote
4. Not attempt to influence the vote outside of the formal meeting

### 8.3 Annual Review

The board must conduct an annual review of all transactions, contracts, and interactions between Wisdom Frontiers and PlayPower Labs. This review should assess:

- Whether each transaction served Wisdom Frontiers' charitable purposes
- Whether prices paid were at or below fair market value
- Whether the overall volume of PlayPower Labs engagements is appropriate
- Whether the relationship continues to serve the mission

The results of this review must be documented in the board minutes and summarized in the annual report.

### 8.4 Board Minutes

Board minutes must document, for every PlayPower Labs-related decision:

- Who disclosed the conflict
- Who recused and who voted
- What alternatives were considered
