# Impact-Edu.ai — Program Description

**A program of Wisdom Frontiers**

## Mission

Impact-Edu.ai advances equitable access to AI-powered learning by producing open research, open-source tools, and practitioner training that help educators and learners — particularly those in under-resourced communities — benefit from advances in artificial intelligence.

## Problem

AI is transforming education, but the benefits are accruing unevenly. Well-funded schools and families adopt AI tutoring tools, personalized learning systems, and intelligent practice platforms while under-resourced schools fall further behind. Meanwhile, educators lack the training and evidence base to make informed decisions about which AI tools actually improve learning outcomes. The field needs:

- **Open research** on what works, grounded in learning science — not vendor marketing
- **Open tools and frameworks** that any school, district, or developer can use
- **Practitioner training** that helps teachers integrate AI effectively, not fearfully
- **Standards and evaluation** so schools can distinguish effective AI tools from hype

## Approach

Impact-Edu.ai is grounded in decades of research from the learning sciences — particularly the work of Carnegie Mellon's LearnLab and the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center — which demonstrated that well-designed intelligent tutoring systems can dramatically improve student outcomes. We bring this research tradition into the current AI moment through four program areas:

### 1. Open Research

We conduct and publish applied research on AI in education, including:

- Efficacy studies of AI tutoring and assessment tools in real classroom settings
- Investigations of how large language models can support (or hinder) deep learning
- Analysis of equity gaps in AI-powered education tools
- Development of measurement frameworks for AI learning impact

All research is published openly and made accessible to practitioners, not just academics.

### 2. Open Tools & Infrastructure

We build and maintain open-source tools that lower the barrier to effective AI in education:

- Open datasets for training and evaluating educational AI
- Reference implementations of evidence-based AI tutoring patterns
- Evaluation frameworks that help educators and districts assess AI tool quality
- Interoperability standards that prevent vendor lock-in

### 3. Practitioner Training

We train educators to be informed, critical, and effective users of AI:

- Professional development programs for teachers and instructional designers
- District-level AI integration planning support
- Train-the-trainer programs that scale through educator networks
- Practical guides and resources freely available online

### 4. Field-Building & Convening

We strengthen the ecosystem connecting researchers, practitioners, developers, and policymakers:

- Annual convening of researchers and practitioners working on AI in education
- Working groups on critical topics (assessment, equity, safety, efficacy)
- Policy briefs that translate research into actionable guidance for decision-makers
- Community of practice for educators implementing AI tools

## Relationship to Play Power Labs

Impact-Edu.ai's Program Director, Derek Lomas, PhD, is also a principal of Play Power Labs, a for-profit company that develops commercial AI-powered educational products. This relationship is disclosed, governed by Wisdom Frontiers' Conflict of Interest Policy, and managed as follows:

- **Distinct missions.** Play Power Labs builds commercial products for paying customers. Impact-Edu.ai produces public goods — open research, open tools, free training — that benefit the entire field regardless of which commercial products schools use.
- **Independent governance.** All Impact-Edu.ai program decisions, including budgets, partnerships, and research agendas, are approved by Wisdom Frontiers' Board of Directors, which is independent of Play Power Labs.
- **Arm's-length transactions.** Any transaction between Wisdom Frontiers/Impact-Edu.ai and Play Power Labs must be at fair market value, documented in writing, and approved by the board with conflicted members recused.
- **Open IP.** All work products funded through Impact-Edu.ai are published openly (open access, open source, Creative Commons) and are not the proprietary property of Play Power Labs or any other commercial entity.
- **Multiple beneficiaries.** Impact-Edu.ai's research, tools, and training are designed to benefit educators, learners, and the field broadly — not to advantage any single commercial product.

## Leadership

**Derek Lomas, PhD — Program Director**
Dr. Lomas earned his PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University under Ken Koedinger, one of the founders of the intelligent tutoring systems field. His research spans learning science, game design, and AI-powered education. He brings deep relationships across the AI and education research communities, philanthropic organizations, and the edtech industry.

**Advisory Board** *(to be constituted)*
Impact-Edu.ai will convene an advisory board of leading researchers, practitioners, and policy experts to guide program strategy and ensure rigor and relevance.

## Budget & Funding

Impact-Edu.ai seeks philanthropic support from foundations committed to educational equity and the responsible development of AI. Initial funding will support:

- Program staff (research lead, practitioner training lead, program coordinator)
- Research partnerships with university labs
- Open-source tool development
- Practitioner training pilot programs
- Convenings and field-building activities

**Year 1 target: $500K - $1.5M** *(adjust based on your actual plans)*

All funds are received and administered by Wisdom Frontiers, a California nonprofit corporation [pending 501(c)(3) determination / operating under fiscal sponsorship of [FISCAL SPONSOR NAME]].
