## Project Title

**AI Across Ages: Piloting AI-Adaptive Learning for Adolescents in Rajasthan Government Schools**

---

## Problem Statement

India faces a compounding learning crisis. According to ASER 2024, over half of Grade 5 students in rural India cannot read a Grade 2 text. Meanwhile, AI-powered adaptive learning tools have demonstrated significant impact in Indian schools — Mindspark showed +0.37 SD gains in math in Delhi (Muralidharan et al., 2019) — but these tools remain inaccessible to the vast majority of students in government schools. The field also lacks comparative evidence on where across the lifespan AI learning tools produce the greatest return, leaving policymakers without guidance on how to prioritize AI-education investment.

## Proposed Innovation

We will pilot an open-source, LLM-powered adaptive learning platform in 10 Rajasthan government schools serving Grades 6-8 students (ages 11-15). The platform combines three innovations:

1. **AI-adaptive content delivery** using a bank of 34,000+ Creative Commons-licensed assessment items calibrated by difficulty, drawn from Impact-Edu.ai's Open Items infrastructure
2. **Multilingual LLM tutoring** in Hindi and English, providing conversational support when students are stuck
3. **SmartPaper assessment** — our computer-vision paper-based assessment system already deployed at scale in Rajasthan (5M+ assessments processed), enabling rigorous pre/post measurement without additional device requirements

The pilot tests the core hypothesis of a larger planned RCT: that AI personalization (not just digital access) is the mechanism that drives learning gains.

## Study Design

**Design:** Cluster-randomized controlled trial
**Sample:** 300 students across 10 government schools in Jaipur district
- 5 schools assigned to AI-adaptive treatment (N=150)
- 5 schools assigned to control (status quo, N=150)
**Duration:** 8 weeks of daily 30-minute sessions
**Assessment:** SmartPaper-administered pre/post mathematics assessment aligned to NCERT curriculum

### Outcomes Measured
- **Primary:** Math achievement (standardized assessment, 0-100 scale)
- **Secondary:** Self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale, Hindi-validated), attendance, time-on-task, platform engagement metrics
- **Exploratory:** Heterogeneity by gender, baseline learning level, and socioeconomic status

### Why Rajasthan
SmartPaper has processed 5M+ assessments in Rajasthan's government school system. We have existing relationships with the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) and District Education Officers. This is not a cold start — we are embedding a new AI capability into an assessment infrastructure that schools already use.

## What This Pilot Produces

1. **Pilot effect estimates** for AI-adaptive learning in Hindi-medium government schools — refining power calculations for a full 6,000-participant, four-cohort RCT planned for J-PAL PAIE or DIV Fund submission
2. **Validated delivery model** — confirming that LLM-powered tutoring works on shared school tablets with intermittent connectivity in Rajasthan
3. **Assessment instruments** — Hindi-medium adaptive assessments validated against SmartPaper, published openly for field use
4. **Implementation playbook** — documenting what it takes to deploy AI learning tools in Indian government schools, shared openly

## Alignment with Grand Challenges India Priorities

- **Global Education:** Directly tests whether AI can close learning gaps in Indian government schools
- **Equitable AI Use:** The intervention targets students in government schools (the lowest-resource tier of India's education system); all tools are open-source and openly licensed
- **LMIC-led:** Field operations led by India-based team; 80%+ of budget flows to Indian institutions and personnel
- **Catalytic:** Pilot data enables competitive applications to J-PAL PAIE ($200K), DIV Fund ($200K-$1.5M), and other funders for the full multi-cohort RCT

## Scalability Pathway

This is not a one-off pilot. The full study design ("AI Across Ages") tests AI's impact across four age cohorts (children 6-10, adolescents 11-15, youth 16-20, adults 21-30) with N=6,000, producing the first evidence comparing AI learning impact across the lifespan in a single context. The pilot de-risks the adolescent cohort — the best-evidenced age group (Mindspark precedent) — and validates the platform and delivery model for all subsequent cohorts.

The platform itself is built on open infrastructure:
- **Open Items:** 34,000+ CC-licensed assessment items, growing to 100K+
- **SmartPaper:** Paper-based adaptive assessment proven at 5M+ scale
- All code, content, and data will be published openly

If the full RCT confirms efficacy, the platform can be adopted through existing government channels (DIKSHA, state ed-tech procurement) at marginal cost.
