# Impact-Edu.ai — MuleRouter Image & Video Generation Prompts

> Prompts for generating visual assets that match the site's warm, paper-textured, academic aesthetic.

## Brand Visual Guidelines

**Aesthetic**: Documentary realism meets academic warmth. Paper textures, handwritten notation, data emerging from analog materials. NOT Silicon Valley tech, NOT stock photography, NOT "AI brain" cliches.
**Color Mood**: Cream/off-white (#faf8f5), burnt orange accent (#c45a2c), warm grays, ink blacks, paper browns
**Lighting**: Warm natural light, golden hour classroom light, overhead documentary-style
**Texture**: Paper grain, pencil marks, handwritten math, printed worksheets, data visualizations
**Setting**: Classrooms (especially developing-world), research workspaces, assessment materials
**Models**: If people appear, they should be diverse students/educators in authentic settings — NOT posed stock

## 1. Homepage Hero Video (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Option A: Paper-to-Data Transformation (5-10s loop)
```
Cinematic close-up: child's hand writing mathematics on lined paper with pencil,
camera slowly pulls back revealing the worksheet on a wooden desk,
handwritten numbers and equations gently transform into glowing data points,
warm golden light from a classroom window,
subtle particle effects as pencil marks become data visualization,
documentary color grade, warm cream and amber tones,
soft focus background suggesting a busy classroom,
2.39:1 cinematic ratio, 24fps, 8 second loop
```

### Option B: Assessment Journey (5-10s loop)
```
Overhead shot: printed math worksheet on warm wooden surface,
a phone camera enters frame scanning the paper,
scan light sweeps across handwritten student work,
the paper's content lifts off and reorganizes into a clean data dashboard,
bar charts and item difficulty curves emerge from the handwriting,
warm paper tones throughout, cream and burnt orange accent color,
documentary feel, natural lighting, gentle camera drift,
16:9 ratio, 24fps, 8 second loop
